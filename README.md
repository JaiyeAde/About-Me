# About-Me: A brief description of my passion, interests and work philosophy.
Hi there! I'm so glad to have you in my space. In a connected word of countless possibilities and emerging solutions, my passion is to be the quill that writes the solutions to the diverse cloud computing bugs, while ensuring a healthy and secure cyber environment for business growth.
I am an AWS cloud developer, a cloud security administrator (Prisma Cloud by Paloalto networks), Incidence responder, SOC analyst, R data analyst and an Azure cloud newbie. 
With over a year experience in cyber security and a growing expertise with AWS cloud development, my work philosophy is simple. Two words: 1. Value and 2. Leverage.
And Yes, I am interested in connecting with you!
